This is a repository for trying out [Steep](https://github.com/soutaro/steep) on GitHub Codespaces.
You can try Steep on your browser only with a few clicks.

## How to use

1. Open this repository on GitHub Codespaces with the following button:

2. It opens VS Code on your browser. Wait a minute...
3. It's ready to use! The editor opens `lib/main.rb` and you can see the result of Steep on the VS Code.
    * Unfortunately you may need to run `Steep: Restart all` command from the command palete. Try this command if Steep looks like it is not working.

Do not forget to delete the codespace from [the codespaces page](https://github.com/codespaces) after you use it to avoid using computing resources.
